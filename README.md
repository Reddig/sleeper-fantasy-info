# sleeper-fantasy-info
This repository is a passion project that I am creating to do some fun things with our fantasy football league!

# Setup
When running, please populate the leagues file with the IDs of any leagues you want to run against. In the Sleeper web interface, the ID can be found in the URL. The format on the home page is `https://sleeper.com/leagues/<ID>/matchup`
